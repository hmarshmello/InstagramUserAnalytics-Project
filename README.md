# Instagram Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

As a data analyst at Instagram, the goal is to analyze user interactions and engagement to provide valuable insights for the growth of the platform. The insights derived from this analysis will be used by various teams, such as marketing, product, and development, to make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.

## SQL Tasks

### A) Marketing Analysis:

1. **Loyal User Reward:**
   - **Task:** Identify the five oldest users on Instagram.

2. **Inactive User Engagement:**
   - **Task:** Identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram.

3. **Contest Winner Declaration:**
   - **Task:** Determine the winner of the contest with the most likes on a single photo.

4. **Hashtag Research:**
   - **Task:** Identify the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform.

5. **Ad Campaign Launch:**
   - **Task:** Determine the day of the week when most users register on Instagram.

### B) Investor Metrics:

6. **User Engagement:**
   - **Task:** Calculate the average number of posts per user and the total number of photos divided by the total number of users.

7. **Bots & Fake Accounts:**
   - **Task:** Identify potential bots (users who have liked every single photo on the site).

These tasks will involve using SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to extract meaningful insights from the Instagram user data. The findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual schema of your database.
